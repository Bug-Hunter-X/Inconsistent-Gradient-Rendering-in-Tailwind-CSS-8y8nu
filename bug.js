```javascript
// Example usage in a React component
<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  {/* ...content... */}
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS gradient classes.  The bug is that while the gradient renders correctly in most cases, on certain browsers or devices, the gradient might not be displayed correctly. It may appear as a solid color, or partially show only one color of the gradient.

This is likely due to browser inconsistencies in handling CSS gradients or some kind of conflict with other CSS rules that affects the gradient behavior.
