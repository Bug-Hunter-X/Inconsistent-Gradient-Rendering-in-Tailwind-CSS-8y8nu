# Inconsistent Gradient Rendering in Tailwind CSS

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS gradients do not render consistently across different browsers and devices.  The gradient may appear as a solid color or only partially display the gradient colors.

## Bug Description
The issue is related to how different browsers handle the CSS gradients used with Tailwind CSS classes.  While the gradient usually displays correctly, inconsistencies can occur, leading to unexpected visual behavior.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the provided React application (requires Node.js and npm or yarn).
3. Observe the gradient rendering in different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
4. Test on different devices if possible (desktop, mobile).

## Solution
The solution involves using a fallback mechanism to ensure the gradient always renders correctly.  This can be achieved by using a less specific gradient implementation as a backup or by adding more specific vendor prefixes.
